Kazoo components as docker images
=================================

Goal
====

To have all kazoo components as independent docker containers.

Notes
=====

1. All components depends on base-os image.
2. Bigcouch is superceded by CouchDB 2.0
3. Actual container configuration is missing (for now they only compiles)
